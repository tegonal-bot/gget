# gget

g(it)get is a bash based script which fetches a file or a directory stored in a git repository including automatic verification via GPG signature.

**The initial idea behind this project**:  
You have scripts you use in multiple projects and would like to have a single place where you maintain them.
Maybe you even made them public so that others can use them as well (as we have done with [Tegonal scripts](https://github.com/tegonal/gget)).
This tool provides an easy way to fetch them into your project. 

---

‚ùó You are taking a _sneak peek_ at the next version.
Please have a look at the README of the git tag in case you are looking for the documentation of the corresponding version.
For instance, the [README of v0.1.0](https://github.com/tegonal/gget/tree/v0.1.0/README.md).

2. extract the zip/tar.gz
3. copy the src directory to a place where you want to store gget e.g. /opt/gget or into your project directory
4. optional: create a symlink `ln -s /opt/gget/gget.sh /usr/local/bin/gget`
