# gget

g(it)get is a bash based script which pulles a file or a directory stored in a git repository.
It including automatic verification via GPG signature.

**The initial idea behind this project**:  
You have scripts you use in multiple projects and would like to have a single place where you maintain them.
Maybe you even made them public so that others can use them as well 
(as we have done with [Tegonal scripts](https://github.com/tegonal/scripts)).
This tool provides an easy way to fetch them into your project.

Likewise, you can use gget to pull config files, templates etc. which you use in multiple projects and want to maintain 
in a single repository.

In this sense, gget is a bit like a package manager which is based on git repositories but without dependency resolution and such.

‚ùó You are taking a _sneak peek_ at the next version.
Please have a look at the README of the git tag in case you are looking for the documentation of the corresponding version.
For instance, the [README of v0.1.0](https://github.com/tegonal/gget/tree/v0.1.0/README.md).
