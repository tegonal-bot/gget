# Gget

Retrieve files stored in a git repository including automatic verification of fingerprint and signature.

**The initial idea behind this project**:  
You have scripts you use in multiple projects and would like to have a single place where you maintain them.
Maybe you even made them public so that others can use them as well (for instance [Tegonal scripts](https://github.com/tegonal/scripts)).
This tool provides an easy way to fetch them into your project.

‚ùó You are taking a _sneak peek_ at the next version.
Please have a look at the README of the git tag in case you are looking for the documentation of the corresponding version.
For instance, the [README of v0.1.0](https://github.com/tegonal/gget/tree/v0.1.0/README.md).
