# gget

g(it)get is a bash based script which pulls a file or a directory stored in a git repository.
It includes automatic verification via GPG signature.  
It enables that files can be maintained at a single places and pulled into multiple projects (e.g. scripts, config files etc.)
In this sense, gget is a bit like a package manager which is based on git repositories but without dependency resolution and such.

<details>
<summary>The initial idea behind this project:</summary>

You have scripts you use in multiple projects and would like to have a single place where you maintain them.
Maybe you even made them public so that others can use them as well 
(as we have done with [Tegonal scripts](https://github.com/tegonal/scripts)).
This tool provides an easy way to fetch them into your project.

Likewise, you can use gget to pull config files, templates etc. which you use in multiple projects but want to maintain 
at a single place.

# Installation

## using install.sh

This script downloads the latest or a specific tag of gget and verifies gget's files against 
the current GPG key (the one in the main branch).

We suggest that you download install.sh and its *.sig file and 
verify the two against our GPG key before actually running it:
```
! [ -f ./install.sh ] || { echo "there is already an install.sh in your directory, aborting"; return 1 } && \
wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tegonal/gget/main/install.sh" && \
wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tegonal/gget/main/install.sh.sig" && \
wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tegonal/gget/main/.gget/signing-key.public.asc | gpg --import - && \
gpg --verify ./install.sh.sig ./install.sh && \
chmod +x ./install.sh && \
echo "verification successful" || { echo "verification failed, don't continue"; return 99 } 
```

<details>
<summary>click here for an explanation of each command</summary>

1. `! [ -f ./install.sh ]`  
   We don't want to override an existing `./install.sh` thus we check if there is already one and abort if this is the case
2. `wget .../install.sh`  
   download the install.sh
3. `wget .../install.sh.sig`  
   download the signature file of install.sh
4. `wget .../signing-key.public.asc | gpg --import -`  
   import the current public key of gget
5. `gpg --verify...`  
   verify the install.sh you downloaded is (still) valid
6. `chmod +x ./install.sh`  
   make install.sh executable
7. `echo "..."`  
   output the result of the verification

</details>

If successful you can install gget by just calling `./install.sh` (you might want to remove it afterwards)

Per default, it downloads the latest tag and installs it into `$HOME/.local/lib/gget` 
and sets up a symbolic link at `$HOME/.local/bin/gget`.

You can tweak this behaviour as shown as follows:
```
# Download the latest tag, configure default installation directory and symbolic link
install.sh

# Download a specific tag, default installation directory and symbolic link
install.sh -t v0.3.0

# Download latest tag but custom installation directory, without the creation of a symbolic link
install.sh -d /opt/gget

# Download latest tag but custom installation directory and symlink
install.sh -d /opt/gget -ln /usr/local/bin
```

Last but not least, see [additional installation steps](#additional-installation-steps)

## manually

1. [![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-v0.4.0-%23007ec6)](https://github.com/tegonal/gget/releases/tag/v0.4.0)
2. extract the zip/tar.gz 
3. open a terminal at the corresponding folder and verify the scripts against our public key:  
   ```bash
   wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tegonal/gget/main/.gget/signing-key.public.asc | gpg --import -
   find ./src -name "*.sig" -print0 | while read -r -d $'\0' sig; do gpg --verify "$sig"; done && echo "verification successful" || echo "verification failed, don't continue"
   ```  
4. copy the src directory to a place where you want to store gget:
   1. For instance, if you only want it for the current user, then place it into $HOME/.local/lib/gget
   2. if it shall be available for all users, then place it e.g. in /opt/gget or
   3. into your project directory in case you want that other contributors can use it as well without an own installation
5. optional: create a symlink:
   1. only for the current user `ln -s "$HOME/.local/lib/gget/src/gget.sh" "$HOME/.local/bin/gget"`
   2. globally `ln -s "$HOME/.local/lib/gget/src/gget.sh" "/usr/local/bin/gget"`
   3. in project: `ln -s ./lib/gget/src/get.sh ./gget`
6. See [additional installation steps](#additional-installation-steps)

### pull hook

You can define the file `pull-hook.sh` in `WORKGIN_DIR/remotes/REMOTE/pull-hook.sh` 
(for instance in `.gget/remotes/tegonal-scripts/pull-hook.sh`), 
make it executable and it will be called for each file which is pulled where the following arguments are passed:
1. tag specified via `-t|--target`
2. path of the file before the move to its target destination
3. target destination

For instance, a hook could look as follows:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -eu -o pipefail
declare tag=$1 source=$2 target=$3
shift 3
echo "before moving $source of tag $tag to $target"
```

## re-pull

</gget-reset-help>

Full usage example:

<gget-reset>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/gget-reset.sh -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# resets all defined remotes, which means for each remote in .gget
# - re-initialise gpg trust based on public keys defined in .gget/remotes/<remote>/public-keys/*.asc
# - pull files defined in .gget/remotes/<remote>/pulled.tsv
gget reset

# resets the remote tegonal-scripts which means:
# - re-initialise gpg trust based on public keys defined in .gget/remotes/tegonal-scripts/public-keys/*.asc
# - pull files defined in .gget/remotes/tegonal-scripts/pulled.tsv
gget reset -r tegonal-scripts

# uses a custom working directory and resets the remote tegonal-scripts which means:
# - re-initialise gpg trust based on public keys defined in .github/.gget/remotes/tegonal-scripts/public-keys/*.asc
# - pull files defined in .github/.gget/remotes/tegonal-scripts/pulled.tsv
gget reset -r tegonal-scripts -w .github/.gget
```

</gget-reset>

# self-update

You can update gget by using gget (which in turn uses its install.sh)

<gget-self-update>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/gget-self-update.sh -->
