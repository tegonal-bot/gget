# gget

g(it)get is a bash based script which fetches a file or a directory stored in a git repository including automatic verification via GPG signature.

**The initial idea behind this project**:  
You have scripts you use in multiple projects and would like to have a single place where you maintain them.
Maybe you even made them public so that others can use them as well (as we have done with [Tegonal scripts](https://github.com/tegonal/gget)).
This tool provides an easy way to fetch them into your project. 

---

‚ùó You are taking a _sneak peek_ at the next version.
Please have a look at the README of the git tag in case you are looking for the documentation of the corresponding version.
For instance, the [README of v0.1.0](https://github.com/tegonal/gget/tree/v0.1.0/README.md).

# Installation

1. [![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-v0.1.0-%23007ec6)](https://github.com/tegonal/gget/releases/tag/v0.1.0)
2. extract the zip/tar.gz
3. copy the src directory to a place where you want to store gget e.g. /opt/gget or into your project directory
4. optional: create a symlink `ln -s /opt/gget/gget.sh /usr/local/bin/gget`

# Usage

Following the output of running `gget --help`:

<gget-help>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/gget.sh -->
```text
Parameters:
-r|--remote              define the name of the remote repository to use
-u|--url                 define the url of the remote repository
-t|--tag                 define which tag should be used to pull the file/directory
-p|--path                define which file or directory shall be fetched
-w|--working-directory   (optional) define a path which gget shall use as working directory -- default: .gget

</gget-help>

Full usage example:

<gget>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/gget.sh -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

current_dir="$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}")" &>/dev/null && pwd 2>/dev/null)"

# Assuming gget.sh is in the same directory as your script
"$current_dir/gget.sh" -r tegonal-scripts -u https://github.com/tegonal/scripts \
	-t v0.1.0 -p src/utility/update-bash-docu.sh \
