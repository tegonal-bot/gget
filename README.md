# gget

g(it)get is a bash based script which fetches a file or a directory stored in a git repository including automatic verification via GPG signature.

**The initial idea behind this project**:  
You have scripts you use in multiple projects and would like to have a single place where you maintain them.
Maybe you even made them public so that others can use them as well (as we have done with [Tegonal scripts](https://github.com/tegonal/gget)).
This tool provides an easy way to fetch them into your project. 

---

‚ùó You are taking a _sneak peek_ at the next version.
Please have a look at the README of the git tag in case you are looking for the documentation of the corresponding version.
For instance, the [README of v0.1.0](https://github.com/tegonal/gget/tree/v0.1.0/README.md).

# adds the remote tegonal-scripts with url https://github.com/tegonal/scripts
gget remote add -r tegonal-scripts -u https://github.com/tegonal/scripts

# lists all existing remotes
gget remote list

# removes the remote tegonal-scripts again
gget remote remove -r tegonal-scripts
```

</gget-remote>

## add

Following the output of running `gget remote add --help`:

<gget-remote-add-help>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/gget-remote.sh -->
```text
Parameters:
-r|--remote              define the name of the remote repository to use
-u|--url                 define the url of the remote repository
-d|--directory           (optional) define into which directory files of this remote will be pulled -- default: lib/<remote>
--unsecure               (optional) if set to true, the remote does not need to have GPG key(s) defined at .gget/*.asc -- default: false
-w|--working-directory   (optional) define a path which gget shall use as working directory -- default: .gget

Examples:
# adds the remote tegonal-scripts with url https://github.com/tegonal/scripts
# uses the default location lib/tegonal-scripts for the files which will be pulled from this remote
gget remote add -r tegonal-scripts -u https://github.com/tegonal/scripts

# uses a custom pull directory, files of the remote tegonal-scripts will now
# be placed into scripts/lib/tegonal-scripts instead of default location lib/tegonal-scripts
gget remote add -r tegonal-scripts -u https://github.com/tegonal/scripts -d scripts/lib/tegonal-scripts

# Does not complain if the remote does not provide a GPG key for verification (but still tries to fetch one)
gget remote add -r tegonal-scripts -u https://github.com/tegonal/scripts --unsecure true

# uses a custom working directory
gget remote add -r tegonal-scripts -u https://github.com/tegonal/scripts -w .github/.gget
